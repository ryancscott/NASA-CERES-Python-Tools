This Python 3 library contains functions to read, process, analyze and visualize data from NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite mission. Functions are included to work with Level 2 swath data & Level 3 time-interpolated and spatially-averaged (TISA) gridded fields. This library is under development for data product development purposes (*_dev) and analysis of official CERES data products. See function descriptions in cerestools.py for more information.
